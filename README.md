# dqn
The repo is mainly for the final project of CS294-112 at UC Berkeley, Spring 2017, instructed by Prof. Sergey Levine, Dr. John Schulmann and Chelsea Finn.

In the repo, the tree style progressive neural network (PNN) is implemented into the OpenAI gym - Atari environment with the DQN method.
The DQN implementation is highly based on the HW3 of the course, which is available [Here](https://github.com/berkeleydeeprlcourse/homework/tree/master/hw3).
The implementation of the PNN is inspired by the repo of seann999. His/her original implementation is available [here](https://github.com/seann999/progressive_a3c)
